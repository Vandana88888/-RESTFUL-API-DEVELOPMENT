**DESCRIPTION OF TASK(In this task, I built a simple RESTful API using Node.js and Express to manage a book inventory system. The API supports core CRUD operations: adding a new book, retrieving all books, updating a book's details, and deleting a book by its ID. Each book entry contains details such as title, author, and publication year. The server was configured and tested locally using tools like Postman or directly through URL endpoints. This task helped me understand how to structure API routes, manage server responses, and handle JSON data efficiently. It also served as an introduction to backend development and API design principles.)
